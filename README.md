Project 1 Starter Code

Names: Grace Duke and Maddie Pero 	
Team Name: maddie-and-grace 

To get our results/graphs for Step 2 (predicted pendulum periods graphs) run the file step1_theoretical_period.py
To get our results/graphs for Step 4 (the real world experimental pendulum graphs) run the file all_plots.py 
To get our results/graphs for Step 5 (the numerical model) run the file step5(2).py
Each file is in the folder for their respective steps


Your final submission should include (on GitHub):

All of your updated Python files
A README.md file explaining what .py files to run to get your results
A .pdf file containing your final plots and a brief report and discussion of results
At least five micro:bit data files from a pendulum for testing your parsing code.
